# KotlinMVP

Simple Android app showcasing basic usage of Kotlin, Retrofit, Rx and **MVP** pattern.
Tested with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito (tests written in Java).

The app is using http://www.icndb.com API to fetch and display list of random Chuck Norris jokes.

To run tests make sure you have 'Unit Tests' build variant selected.
