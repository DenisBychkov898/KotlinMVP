# KotlinMVP
Simple Android app created using Kotlin, Retrofit, Rx and MVP pattern. 

Tested with JUnit, Robolectric and Mockito (tests written in Java).

The app is using http://www.icndb.com API to fetch and display list of random Chuck Norris jokes.

To run tests make sure you have 'Unit Tests' build variant selected.

NOTE As of 01.01.2017 this example has become a bit old, rusty and needs some updates considering new MVP, RX, Clean Architecture standards. I shall take care of it when I have some time.
